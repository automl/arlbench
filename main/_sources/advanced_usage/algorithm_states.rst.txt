Using the ARLBench States
==========================

In addition to providing different objectives, ARLBench also provides insights into the target algorithms' **internal states**. This is done using so called `StateFeatures`.

As of now, we implement the `GradInfo` state feature which returns the **norm and variance of the gradients observed during training**.
The used state features can be defined using the `state_features` key in the config passed to the AutoRL Environment. 
Please include `grad_info` in this list if you want to use this state feature for your approach.
We are currently working on extending this part of ARLBench to other state features as well.
