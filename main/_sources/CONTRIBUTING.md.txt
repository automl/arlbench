# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/automl/arlbench/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

ARLBench could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official ARLBench docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/automl/arlbench/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `arlbench` for local development.

1. Fork the `arlbench` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:
```
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/arlbench.git
    $ cd arlbench
```

3. Install your local copy into a conda env:
```
    $ conda create -n arlbench python=3.10
    $ conda activate arlbench
    $ make install-dev
```

4. Create a branch for local development:
```
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass ruff:
```
    $ make format
```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:
```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.10 and above. This should be tested in the GitHub workflows.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```
$ make test

```

## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run:

```
$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags
```

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
