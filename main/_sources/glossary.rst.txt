    HPO
        Hyperparameter Optimization. The process of finding the best hyperparameters for a given
        machine learning model.
    
    AutoRL
        Automated Reinforcement Learning. The process of automating the process of applying
        reinforcement learning to real-world problems.

    AutoML
        Automated Machine Learning. The process of automating the process of applying machine
        learning to real-world problems.

    Random Search
        A hyperparameter optimization algorithm that randomly samples hyperparameters from a
        predefined search space.

    BO
        Bayesian Optimization. A Black-Box optimization algorithm weighing exploration & exploitation
        to find the minimum of its objective.

    Multi-fidelity optimization
        The process of optimizing a function using multiple levels of fidelity. This can be done by
        using a surrogate model to approximate the function at different levels of fidelity.

    PPO
        Proximal Policy Optimization. A policy gradient method that uses a clipped surrogate objective
        to improve the stability of the learning process.

    DQN
        Deep Q-Network. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a neural network to approximate
        the Q-function.

    SAC 
        Soft Actor-Critic. An off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that uses the maximum entropy
        principle to improve the exploration of the environment.
