Objectives in ARLBench
======================

ARLBench allows to configure the objectives you'd like to use for your AutoRL methods. 
These are selected as a list of keywords in the configuration of the AutoRL Environment, e.g. like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    python arlbench.py autorl.objectives=["reward_mean"]

The following objectives are available at the moment:

- **reward_mean**: the mean evaluation reward across a number of evaluation episodes
- **reward_std**: the standard deviation of the evaluation rewards across a number of evaluation episodes
- **runtime**: the runtime of the training process
- **emissions**: the CO2 emissions of the training process, tracked using `CodeCarbon <https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon>`_.
